<p>This Embedded Base Boot Requirements (EBBR) specification defines an interface
between platform firmware and an operating system that is suitable for embedded
platforms.
EBBR compliant platforms present a consistent interface that will boot an EBBR
compliant operating system without any custom tailoring required.
For example, an Arm A-class embedded platform will benefit
from a standard interface that supports features such as secure boot and
firmware update.</p>
<p>This specification defines the base firmware requirements for EBBR compliant
platforms.
The requirements in this specification are expected to be minimal yet complete,
while leaving plenty of room for innovations and design details.
This specification is intended to be OS-neutral.</p>
<p>It leverages the prevalent industry standard firmware specification of <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#uefi" id="id1"><span>[UEFI]</span></a>.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>Guiding Principles<a class="headerlink" href="#guiding-principles" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>EBBR as a specification defines requirements on platforms and operating systems,
but requirements alone don’t provide insight into why the specification is
written the way it is, or what problems it is intended to solve.
Using the assumption that better understanding of the thought process behind
EBBR will result in better implementations, this section is a discussion of the
goals and guiding principle that shaped EBBR.</p>
<p>This section should be considered commentary, and not a formal part of the
specification.</p>
<p>EBBR was written as a response to the lack of boot sequence standardization in
the embedded system ecosystem.
As embedded systems are becoming more sophisticated and connected,
it is becoming increasingly important for embedded systems to run standard OS
distributions and software stacks, or to have consistent behaviour across a
large deployment of heterogeneous platforms.
However, the lack of consistency between platforms often requires per-platform
customization to get an OS image to boot on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>A large part of this ecosystem is based on U-Boot and Linux.
Vendors have heavy investments in both projects and are not interested in large
scale changes to their firmware architecture.
The challenge for EBBR is to define a set of boot standards that reduce the
amount of custom engineering required, make it possible for OS distributions to
support embedded platforms, while still preserving the firmware stack that
product vendors are comfortable with.
Or in simpler terms, EBBR is designed to reduce the embedded boot differences by
implementing a widely accepted standard (UEFI) in existing firmware projects
(U-Boot).</p>
<p>However, EBBR is a specification, not an implementation.
The goal of EBBR is not to mandate U-Boot and Linux.
Rather, it is to mandate interfaces that can be implemented by any firmware or
OS project, while at the same time work with both Tianocore/EDK2 and U-Boot to
ensure that the EBBR requirements are implemented by both projects.
<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#edk2note" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<aside class="footnote-list brackets">
<aside class="footnote brackets" id="edk2note" role="doc-footnote">
<span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id2">1</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>Tianocore/EDK2 and U-Boot are highlighted here because at the
time of writing these are the two most important firmware projects that
implement UEFI.
Tianocore/EDK2 is a full featured UEFI implementation and so should
automatically be EBBR compliant.
U-Boot is the incumbent firmware project for embedded platforms and has
steadily been adding UEFI compliance since 2016.</p>
</aside>
</aside>
<p>The following guiding principles are used while developing the EBBR
specification.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be agnostic about ACPI and Devicetree.</p>
<p>EBBR explicitly does not require a specific system description language.
Both Devicetree and ACPI are supported.
The Linux kernel supports both equally well, and so EBBR doesn’t require one
over the other.
However, EBBR does require the system description to be supplied by the
platform, not the OS.
The platform must also conform to the relevant ACPI or DT specifications and
adhere to platform compatibility rules. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#compatrules" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<aside class="footnote-list brackets">
<aside class="footnote brackets" id="compatrules" role="doc-footnote">
<span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id3">2</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>It must be acknowledged that at the time of writing this
document, platform compatibility rules for DT platforms are not well defined
or documented.
We the authors recognize that this is a problem and are working to solve it
in parallel with this specification.</p>
</aside>
</aside>
<ul>
<li><p>Focus on the UEFI interface, not a specific codebase</p>
<p>EBBR does not require a specific firmware implementation.
Any firmware project can implement these interfaces.
Neither U-Boot nor Tianocore/EDK2 are required.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Design to be implementable and useful today</p>
<p>The drafting process for EBBR worked closely with U-Boot and Tianocore
developers to ensure that current upstream code will meet the requirements.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Design to be OS independent</p>
<p>This document uses Linux as an example but other OS’s support EBBR compliant
systems as well (e.g. FreeBSD, OpenBSD).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support multiple architectures</p>
<p>Any architecture can implement the EBBR requirements.
Architecture specific requirements will clearly marked as to which
architecture(s) they apply.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Design for common embedded hardware</p>
<p>EBBR support will be implemented on existing developer hardware.
Generally anything that has a near-upstream U-Boot implementation should be
able to implement the EBBR requirements.
EBBR was drafted with readily available hardware in mind, like the
Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone families of boards, and it is applicable for low
cost boards (&lt;$10).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Plan to evolve over time</p>
<p>The current release of EBBR is firmly targeted at existing platforms so that
gaining EBBR compliance may require a firmware update, but will not require
hardware changes for the majority of platforms.</p>
<p>Future EBBR releases will tighten requirements to add features and improve
compatibility, which may affect hardware design choices.
However, EBBR will not retroactively revoke support from previously compliant
platforms.
Instead, new requirements will be clearly documented as being over and above
what was required by a previous release.
Existing platforms will be able to retain compliance with a previous
requirement level.
In turn, OS projects and end users can choose what level of EBBR compliance
is required for their use case.</p>

The UEFI requirements found in this document are similar but not identical to
the requirements found in BBR.
EBBR provides greater flexibility to support embedded designs which cannot
easily meet the stricter BBR requirements.</p>
<p>By definition, all BBR compliant systems are also EBBR compliant, but the
converse is not true.</p>

The exact meaning of this is architecture dependent, as detailed below.</p>
<p>Resident UEFI firmware might target a specific privilege level.
In contrast, UEFI Loaded Images, such as third-party drivers and boot

<p>Firmware shall not create runtime mappings, or perform any runtime IO that will
conflict with device access by the OS.
Normally this means a device may be controlled by firmware, or controlled by
the OS, but not both.
E.g. if firmware attempts to access an eMMC device at runtime then it will
conflict with transactions being performed by the OS.</p>
<p>Devices that are provided to the OS (i.e., via PCIe discovery or ACPI/DT
description) shall not be accessed by firmware at runtime.
Similarly, devices retained by firmware (i.e., not discoverable by the OS)
shall not be accessed by the OS.</p>
<p>Only devices that explicitly support concurrent access by both firmware and an
OS may be mapped at runtime by both firmware and the OS.</p>

<h5><span class="section-number">2.7.1.1. </span>Real-time Clock (RTC)<a class="headerlink" href="#real-time-clock-rtc" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>Not all embedded systems include an RTC, and even if one is present,
it may not be possible to access the RTC from runtime services.
e.g., The RTC may be on a shared I2C bus which runtime services cannot access

<p>However, if firmware does not support access to the RTC after

<p><cite>ResetSystem()</cite> is required to be implemented in boot services, but it is

During runtime services, the operating system should first attempt to

<p>On AArch64 platforms implementing <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#psci" id="id20"><span>[PSCI]</span></a>,

<h4><span class="section-number">2.7.3. </span>Runtime Variable Access<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-variable-access" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>There are many platforms where it is difficult to implement <cite>SetVariable()</cite> for
non-volatile variables during runtime services because the firmware cannot
access storage after <cite>ExitBootServices()</cite> is called.</p>
<p>e.g., If firmware accesses an eMMC device directly at runtime, it will
collide with transactions initiated by the OS.
Neither U-Boot nor Tianocore have a generic solution for accessing or updating
variables stored on shared media. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#opteesupplicant" id="id21" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>7<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<p>It is worth noting that OP-TEE has a similar problem
regarding secure storage.
OP-TEE’s chosen solution is to rely on an OS supplicant agent to perform
storage operations on behalf of OP-TEE.
The same solution may be applicable to solving the UEFI non-volatile
variable problem, but it requires additional OS support to work.
Regardless, EBBR compliance does not require <cite>SetVariable()</cite> support
during runtime services.</p>

<p>If a platform does not implement modifying non-volatile variables with
<cite>SetVariable()</cite> after <cite>ExitBootServices()</cite>,
then firmware shall return <cite>EFI_UNSUPPORTED</cite> for any call to <cite>SetVariable()</cite>,

<p>Even when <cite>SetVariable()</cite> is not supported during runtime services, firmware

<p>In general, EBBR compliant platforms should use dedicated storage for boot
firmware images and data,
independent of the storage used for OS partitions and the EFI System Partition
(ESP).
This could be a physically separate device (e.g. SPI flash),
or a dedicated logical unit (LU) within a device
(e.g. eMMC boot partition, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#emmcbootpartition" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>
or UFS boot LU <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#logicalunitnote" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>).</p>

<p>Watch out for the ambiguity of the word ‘partition’.
In most of this document, a ‘partition’ is a contiguous region of a block
device as described by a GPT or MBR partition table,
but eMMC devices also provide a dedicated ‘boot partition’ that is addressed
separately from the main storage region, and does not appear in the
partition table.</p>
</aside>

<span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id2">2</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>For the purposes of this document, logical units are
treated as independent storage devices, each with their own GPT or MBR
partition table.
A platform that uses one LU for firmware, and another LU for OS partitions
and the ESP is considered to be using dedicated firmware storage.</p>
</aside>
</aside>
<p>However, many embedded systems have size, cost, or implementation
constraints that make separate firmware storage unfeasible.
On such systems, firmware and the OS reside in the same storage device.
Care must be taken to ensure firmware kept in normal storage does not
conflict with normal usage of the media by an OS.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Firmware must be stored on the media in a way that does not conflict
with normal partitioning and usage by the operating system.</p></li>
<li><p>Normal operation of the OS must not interfere with firmware files.</p></li>
<li><p>Firmware needs a method to modify variable storage at runtime while the
OS controls access to the device. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#luvariables" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p></li>

<p>Runtime access to firmware data may still be an issue when
firmware is stored in a dedicated LU, simply because the OS remains in
control of the storage device command stream. If firmware doesn’t have
a dedicated channel to the storage device, then the OS must proxy all
runtime storage IO.</p>

<p>For example, if the SoC boot ROM requires an MBR to

<p>Where possible, firmware images and data should be stored in a filesystem.
Firmware can be stored either in a dedicated firmware partition,
or in certain circumstances in the UEFI System Partition (ESP).
Using a filesystem makes it simpler to manage multiple firmware files and
makes it possible for a single disk image to contain firmware for multiple
platforms.</p>
<p>When firmware is stored in the ESP, the ESP should contain a directory named
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/FIRMWARE</span></code> in the root directory,
and all firmware images and data should be stored in platform vendor
subdirectories under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/FIRMWARE</span></code>.</p>
<p>Dedicated firmware partitions should be formatted with a FAT
filesystem as defined in <a class="reference external" href="https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.11/13_Protocols_Media_Access.html#file-system-format">UEFI § 13.3 File System Format</a>.
Dedicated firmware partitions should use the same <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/FIRMWARE</span></code> directory
hierarchy.
OS tools shall ignore dedicated firmware partitions,
and shall not attempt to use a dedicated firmware partition as an ESP.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">4.2.1. </span>The firmware directory hierarchy<a class="headerlink" href="#the-firmware-directory-hierarchy" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Vendors may choose their own subdirectory name under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/FIRMWARE</span></code>,
but shall choose names that do not conflict with other vendors.
Normally the vendor name will be the name of the SoC vendor, because the
firmware directory name will be hard coded in the SoC’s boot ROM.
Vendors are recommended to use their Devicetree vendor prefix or ACPI
vendor ID as their vendor subdirectory name.</p>
<p>Vendors are free to decide how to structure subdirectories under their
own vendor directory, but they shall use a naming convention that allows
multiple SoCs to be supported in the same filesystem.</p>
<p>For example, a vendor named Acme with two SoCs, AM100 &amp; AM300, could
choose to use the SoC part number as a subdirectory in the firmware path:</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.3. </span>Shared Storage Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#shared-storage-requirements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The sections below discuss the requirements when using both fixed and
removable storage.
However, it should be noted that the recommended behaviour of firmware
should be identical regardless of storage type.
In both cases, the recommended boot sequence is to first search for firmware
in a dedicated firmware partition, and second search for firmware in the
ESP.
The only difference between fixed and removable storage is the recommended
factory settings for the platform.</p>
<section id="fixed-shared-storage">
<h4><span class="section-number">4.3.1. </span>Fixed Shared Storage<a class="headerlink" href="#fixed-shared-storage" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Fixed storage is storage that is permanently attached to the platform,
and cannot be moved between systems.
eMMC and Universal Flash Storage (UFS) device are often used as
shared fixed storage for both firmware and the OS.</p>
<p>Where possible, it is preferred for the system to boot from a dedicated boot
region on media that provides one (e.g., eMMC) that is sufficiently large.
Otherwise, the platform storage should be pre-formatted in the factory with
a partition table, a dedicated firmware partition, and firmware binaries
installed.</p>
<p>Operating systems must not use the dedicated firmware partition for installing
EFI applications including, but not limited to, the OS loader and OS specific
files. Instead, a normal ESP should be created.
OS partitioning tools must take care not to modify or delete dedicated
firmware partitions.</p>
</section>
<section id="removable-shared-storage">
<h4><span class="section-number">4.3.2. </span>Removable Shared Storage<a class="headerlink" href="#removable-shared-storage" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Removable storage is any media that can be physically removed from
the system and moved to another machine as part of normal operation
(e.g., SD cards, USB thumb drives, and CDs).</p>
<p>There are two primary scenarios for storing firmware on removable media.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Platforms that only have removable media (e.g., The Raspberry Pi has an
SD card slot, but no fixed storage).</p></li>
<li><p>Recovery when on-board firmware has been corrupted. If firmware on
fixed media has been corrupted, some platforms support loading firmware
from removable media which can then be used to recover the platform.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases, it is desirable to start with a stock OS boot image,
copy it to the media (SD or USB), and then add the necessary firmware files
to make the platform bootable.
Typically, OS boot images won’t include a dedicated firmware partition,
and it is inconvenient to repartition the media to add one.
It is simpler and easier for the user if they are able to copy
the required firmware files into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/FIRMWARE</span></code> directory tree on the ESP
using the basic file manager tools provided by all desktop operating systems.</p>
<p>On removable media, firmware should be stored in the ESP under the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/FIRMWARE</span></code> directory structure as described in
<a class="reference internal" href="#section-fw-partition-fs"><span class="std std-ref">Firmware Partition Filesystem</span></a>.
Platform vendors should support their platform by providing a single
.zip file that places all the required firmware files in the correct
locations when extracted in the ESP <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/FIRMWARE</span></code> directory.
For simplicity sake, it is expected the same .zip file will recover the
firmware files in a dedicated firmware partition.</p>

<p>Some UEFI enabled devices can only store EFI variables as a file on a block
device. This implies that at runtime the operating system must manage changes
to the EFI variable by updating the file.</p>
<p>This chapter defines a file-format for EFI variables that both the firmware
and the operating system can rely on.</p>
<p>All integer fields are stored in little-endian byte order.</p>

<p>The security of a file based variable storage is limited by the security
of the storage or transport medium. Without further measures file storage
is inadequate for the UEFI security database and other authenticated
variables.</p>
<p>The current version of the file format can convey the timestamp of
time-based authenticated variables. It does not define the storage of the
signing certificates of nonce-based authenticated variables. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#certnote" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
